# Arrays are lists of things
#mixed_array = ["tacos", 12, true]
#puts mixed_array

shopping_lists = [["milk", "eggs", "toilet paper"], ["soap", "shampoo", "shaving cream", "toilet paper"]]
#p#uts shopping_lists
#puts shopping_lists[1][2]
# Accessing the array
#favorite_foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "ice cream"]
#favorite_foods = favorite_foods + ["french fries", "ramen"]
#puts favorite_foods

full_shopping_list = shopping_lists[0] + shopping_lists[1]
puts full_shopping_list
##ull_shopping_list = shopping_lists[0] + shopping_lists[1]
#puts full_shopping_list
# Add to the array
